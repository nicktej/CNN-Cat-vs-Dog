# Cat vs Dog

This is a CNN used to analyze pictures of cats and dogs. It is able to tell cats and dogs apart! Isn't that cute?

## Mechanics and Measurements

The CNN has 3 hidden layers, and uses an Adam optimizer. The accuracy I achieve was 90%. 

## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 3. You will need TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this.
